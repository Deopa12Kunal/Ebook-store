Project Description: Building a Robust Book Management API
This project involves the development of a comprehensive Book Management API using modern web technologies and best practices.
The API allows users to register, login, and manage a collection of books. Here's an overview of the key components and features:
Project Setup:

1: Node.js project initialization
TypeScript configuration for type-safe development
Git version control setup
Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development
ESLint for code linting and Prettier for consistent code formatting.
2:Core Technologies:
Express.js as the web application framework
MongoDB as the database, with Mongoose for object modeling
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication
3: Environment and Configuration:
Configuration file setup for managing application settings
Environment variable management for different deployment scenarios
4:Error Handling:
Custom error handling middleware for consistent error responses
Advanced error handling techniques for improved debugging and user feedback
5:User Management:
User registration endpoint with data validation
User login endpoint with JWT token generation.
6:Book Resource Management:
CRUD operations for books (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
File upload handling with Multer for book covers and PDF files
Integration with Cloudinary for cloud-based file storage
Temporary file management and deletion
7:API Features:
Endpoint for creating new books with cover images and PDF files
Update book information and files
Retrieve all books and individual book details
Delete books with associated file cleanup
8:Security and Optimization:
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration for API access control
Secure file handling and storage
9:Testing:
Comprehensive testing of the Book API endpoints
This project demonstrates a full-stack approach to building a secure and scalable API,
incorporating best practices in Node.js development, database management, file handling, and API design. 
It provides a solid foundation for a book management system that can be extended or integrated into larger applications
